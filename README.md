# -SmartWater-IoT-System
 This repository contains the codebase for a smart water management system using IoT. The system monitors water levels, pH value, and turbidity in real-time. It automatically controls a water pump based on water level readings and sends alerts for abnormal pH or turbidity levels. The project aims to enhance water management efficiency and ensure water quality.

Key Features:

Real-time monitoring of water levels, pH, and turbidity
Automatic pump control based on water level thresholds
Alerts and notifications for abnormal water quality parameters
Historical data logging and visualization
Integration with cloud services for remote monitoring and control
